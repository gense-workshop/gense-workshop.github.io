Generative AI models that generate source code or structured data are becoming important tools in software engineering. However, erroneous or incorrect outputs can cause faults leading to errors in software applications. In this workshop we will discuss these risks and approaches to solve them. In particular, neurosymbolic methods that combine data-driven learning systems and symbolic, logical approaches represent a promising path.

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit contributions to the following topics (this list is not exhaustive):

-	Generative AI methods in software engineering.
-	Neurosymbolic approaches applied to software engineering problems.
-	Risks of the application of generative AI methods in software engineering.
-	AI-generated computer code.
-	AI-generated structured data (e.g. as instances of domain-specific languages).
-	Generation of error-free source code and/or structure data (including testing).
-	Integration of symbolic approaches in generative models.
-	Uses of symbolic methods for verification/correction of model outputs.
-   AI-supported No-Code or Low-Code approaches.
-   Security in AI-generated code.
-	Industrial applications of Generative AI.
-   Agentic AI, multi-agent systems and orchestration.
-   AIOps.
